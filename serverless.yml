  # gain visibility of requests throughout the system.
  tracing:
    apiGateway: true

  # Enable API Gateway request logging. The default configuration includes full
  # request/response logging to a CloudWatch log group and access logging to
  # another. AWS does not recommend enabling full request/response logging in
  # production environments due to the potential for recording sensitive data.
  # This may be something to revisit and make more configurable via an option.

# Lambda function definitions. Each function defines itself in a separate YAML
# file that resides alongside the function implementation. Unfortunately we have
# to duplicate the function name here due to the way Serverless YAML importing
# and parsing works (in an ideal world we could include these in a list as we do
# for resources).
functions:
  hello: ${file(src/functions/hello/index.yml):hello}

# Custom AWS resource definitions. This includes anything that the Serverless
# framework doesn't handle for us, such as database setup, and overrides of
# Serverless defaults.
#
# An example file has been included here to demonstrate the way we like to
# separate custom CloudFormation resources into files by type. You can safely
# delete the example file and this reference to it.

# Custom configuration. This is where Serverless Framework plugins get their

  splitStacks:

# Serverless plugins. The "split-stacks" plugin is used to generate nested
# CloudFormation stacks to work around the hard limit of 200 resources per
# stack.
